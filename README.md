Prototype for a Test I was giving. It was a great way to get some practice with particle effects, shaders and setting up a custom camera system and focusing on visual feedback.
The documentation for the stuff I've implemented can be found [here](https://github.com/DoesDevStuff/platformer-rapid-prototype/blob/main/Documentation%20-%20Gameplay_Programmer_Test.pdf)
