# Summary
Prototype for a Test I was giving. It was a great way to get some practice with particle effects, shaders and setting up a custom camera system and focusing on visual feedback.
The documentation for the stuff I've implemented can be found [here](https://github.com/DoesDevStuff/platformer-rapid-prototype/blob/main/Documentation%20-%20Gameplay_Programmer_Test.pdf)

## Video Demonstration:

1. Player Movement, Making the spikes seem dangerous
   - Player was made to feel heavier (i.e. They fall faster that they jump) and have a dust trail behind them and dust particles when they land and a little bounce effect to make it seem like it's breathing
   - Added particles that spawn on death, as well as randomised blood splatter and some knockback with player tilting when it lands.<br>

2. Bounce Pad
   - Added a ripple shader effect <br>
